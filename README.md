# Connect 4 - React Game with AI

## Project Information

**Project Name:** Connect 4 - AI Game  
**Creator:** Sonny Mijael
**Technology Stack:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Confetti  
**AI Algorithm:** Rule-based heuristic evaluation for move selection

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Connect 4 game** built with React and TypeScript, featuring an AI opponent that plays against the user. The AI evaluates board positions to make strategic moves, and the game includes a responsive UI with animations and confetti effects when a player wins.
